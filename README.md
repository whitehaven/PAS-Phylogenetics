PAS-Phylogenetics
=================

Phylogenetics of PAS Kinase genes.

Goals:
Have 50+ sequences input
* segregate by file into category
	* yeasts
	* unicellular
	* multicellular
	
uses MEGA6.05 as of Dec 1 2014

Update 2015-06-23 2237
----------------------

* Found automated method for downloading .fasta sequences
* Upped cohort of analytes to 389 sequences (based on better-than-e-60)
* Made tree - quite confusing, needs work

* Next directions:
	* Clean up tree
	* Find cross-species enzymology paper - use to broaden search
	
* Updated to MEGA6.06
